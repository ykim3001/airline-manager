## Technologies
Our team has used Java, JavaFX, MySQL to create a desktop application that provides an UI integrated with the database.
* AirlineManagement.java file handles UI and calling functions from DatabaseConnect.java
* DatabaseConnect.java file connects to the MySQL database and creates functions that convert SQL queries to Java compatible ones. 
* 2 SQL files are for the database and procedure/view setup.

## Work distribution

* Jun Yeop Kim: Initial setup for database connection and UI, procedure 1, view 19, flight managment tables 1~14
